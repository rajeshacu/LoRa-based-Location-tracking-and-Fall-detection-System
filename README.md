LoRa-Based Trekker Safety System
Overview

This project addresses the safety challenges faced by trekkers in remote areas with no mobile/Wi-Fi coverage. It provides fall detection using motion sensors and offline location tracking via LoRa-based signal strength (RSSI) trilateration with a range of 10â€“15 km. The system sends real-time emergency alerts without relying on cellular/GPS networks.
Technical Stack

    Hardware: ESP32, LoRa (RA-02), MPU6050 (Accelerometer/Gyroscope)

    Communication: LoRa (long-range), Bluetooth/Wi-Fi (local)

    Firmware: MicroPython (ESP32)

    Frontend: React Native (mobile), Next.js (dashboard)

    Location Algorithm: RSSI-based trilateration

Key Features

    Offline operation (no GPS/mobile networks required)

    Low power consumption for extended treks

    Real-time fall detection using motion sensors

    Location approximation via fixed LoRa nodes

    User-friendly mobile interface

How It Works

    Wearable Device: ESP32 + LoRa module sends periodic signals; MPU6050 detects falls.

    Fixed Nodes: Deployed at known locations to capture signals and estimate position via trilateration.

    User Interface: Displays location and emergency alerts via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi.

Expected Outcomes

    Improved safety for trekkers in remote areas

    Timely emergency response without network dependency

    Post-trek analysis for better route planning
